            determinant of a healthy weight, it offers a valuable starting point
            to evaluate your overall health and well-being

          <h2>What your BMI result means</h2>
          <p>A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight'. Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for five days a week.</p>

        <h2>Limitations of BMI</h2>
        <p>Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not suited for every person. Specific groups should carefully consider their BMI outcomes, and in certain cases, the measurement may not be beneficial to use.</p>
        <div class="limitation-item">

            <h4>Gender</h4>
          </div>
          <p>The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with age. Consequently, a child's age and gender are considered when evaluating their BMI.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="limitation-item">

            <img src="" alt="Age Icon">
            <h4>Age</h4>
          </div>
          <p>In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause BMI to underestimate body fat content.</p>

            <img src="" alt="Muscle Icon">
            <h4>Muscle</h4>
          </div>
          <p>BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or obese, as it doesn't differentiate muscle from fat.</p>

            <h4>Pregnancy</h4>
          </div>
          <p>Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to their growing baby. Maintaining a healthy pre-pregnancy BMI is advisable to minimise health risks for both mother and child.</p>
